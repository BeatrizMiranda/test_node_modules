   ## Decision Context
  After a discussion with the team about accessibility, we decided the
  right decision is for us to not open these on "hover" and do it by
  clicking or tapping. The way this tooltip functions is closer to a
  modal opened by a button vs. a traditional tooltip. The difference
  between the two being a traditional tooltip is short text describing
  what the hovered item is vs. a large amount of text with actions,
  buttons, lists, etc. which is closer to a modal.

  One big reason for this is that when tabbing through items on a
  keyboard, it's standard practice that you activate the same "hover"
  effects that you would when you hover over something with your mouse.
  The problem is that these massive tooltips would open up as users
  would tab through content and they would be forced to tab through all
  the contents of the tooltips to close it, creating a burdened UX for
  them.

  Another thing is that on mobile, the default behavior of Tooltips
  defined by MUI is for them to show up when the user holds their finger
  on the tooltip trigger, which would cause the tooltip to show up until
  1.5s after they let go of the trigger. This obviously wouldn't work
  for the use-case we're designing for, so mobile also follows a
  click-close format.

  In the future if we ever have simpler, smaller, no-action tooltips
  being used in a new way, we should revisit the hover vs. click topic.
